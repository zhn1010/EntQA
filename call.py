Since one year DHL supports the world’s largest pump manufacturer and water solutions provider to decarbonize ocean and air freight shipments by providing GoGreen Plus insetting solutions. Both companies share a sustainable vision and regard this partnership as an important milestone on their science-based path to carbon neutrality.\n\n“We are deeply committed to helping our customers reach their sustainability goals by reducing carbon emissions along the supply lanes. Working together with the world’s leading pump manufacturer Grundfos is a great pleasure for us, as we both share a common perspective regarding the need to achieve carbon neutrality through auditable and scalable carbon-cutting solutions. Our GoGreen Plus services helped Grundfos decarbonize their ocean and air freight routes and we look forward to continuing this strategic partnership,” says Torben Pagh, Managing Director DHL Global Forwarding Denmark.\n\nDHL Global Forwarding focuses on reducing Grundfos’ carbon emissions in ocean freight transportation for both less-than-container-load (LCL) and full-container-load shipments (FCL) via its GoGreen Plus service. The LCL GoGreen Plus service comes even without any additional costs for customers. Last year, both companies also launched a pilot project which aimed to reduce carbon emissions in air freight shipments (AFR). Grundfos accessed DHL Global Forwarding’s AFR GoGreen Plus service which cuts emissions in air transportation by using Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF).\n\n\n\n“Grundfos produces more than 16 Mln pumps a year and ships more than 20.000 containers over the ocean every year. Grundfos always pioneered in water solutions to address the water and climate challenges in the world and improve quality of life for people. That is part of our core and DNA, says Dirk van der Heijden, Senior Director Global Logistics in Grundfos. “A testimony of that DNA is that Grundfos is the first company in the water solution sector to receive the full validation from SBTI (Science Based Target Initiative) of our net-zero emission target by 2050. The use of alternative biofuels from DHL Global Forwarding as one of our global ocean partners allows us to decarbonize our Ocean transport port to port. At the same time together we stimulate the freight industry to invest in a sustainable future. An industry which is critical for our company Grundfos.\n\nDHL’s GoGreen Plus service is based on the insetting approach where customers are offered various solutions for minimizing logistics-related emissions along the entire supply chain. DHL Global Forwarding’s GoGreen Plus solution is facilitating a sustainable fuel switch. Hereby carriers consume sustainable fuel on behalf of DHL. Subsequently the resulting Scope 3 emission reductions are passed on to DHL and will then be allocated to cargo owners. This allocation is linked to the transport profile to the GoGreen Plus shipments of the cargo owner. Both DHL Global Forwarding and Grundfos aim to strengthen their ambitions to align with the Paris Agreement and adhere to the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi), which aims to define a path towards zero carbon emissions based on scientific and auditable measures."}'
